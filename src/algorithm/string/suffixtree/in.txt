 The morning after a 2005 videotape of Donald Trump remarking to Access Hollywood host Billy Bush that fame gave him license to grab women by the pussy the shame resistant Republican presidential nominee was finally suffering consequences for his outrageous statements But for the media organizations covering his comments this was a big moment on another level After what one New York Times editor described as extensive discussion the Times broke one of its cardinal style rules The words fuck pussy bitch and tits appeared in print on the front page This had never happened before According to the most recent New York Times Manual of Style and Usage the Times very rarely publishes obscene words and it maintains a steep threshold for vulgar ones Very rarely is itself a relaxation of standards previous editions of the manual said the Times virtually never publishes obscenities The Times main argument for treating such words as unprintable is the need to maintain standards of civility Yet article after article will still describe uncensored acts of war torture child abuse and other uncivil behavior But the boundaries between polite society and popular culture had been blurring long before Donald Trump came on the scene These changes in public discourse have made profanity more prevalent and therefore less shocking which only makes the Times position seem increasingly outdated In fact profanity has become so commonplace that the Times has had to find ways to report obscenities without actually using the obscenities themselves Even when the subject of the story is a profanely named product the Times will coyly write around it The best selling picture book Go the Fuck to Sleep for instance was the subject of three Times articles that failed to mention the title The best selling picture book Go the Fuck to Sleep for instance was the subject of three Times articles that failed to mention the title After reading all three I wrote a blog post noting the Times timidity Every so often I noticed another writer peeved by a missing expletive would commit several hours and hundreds of words to making arguments about hypocrisy changing social mores and the porous media ecosystem and nothing would change I didn t expect my post would make a difference either But writing an article is not the only way to make a point This was in 2011 when data journalism was on the rise Nate Silver had licensed his website FiveThirtyEight to the Times and Quartz would launch the following year Every time I noticed the Times avoiding an obscenity I began to document the instance on Twitter using the hashtag fittoprint and invited others to join me Eventually I thought I would have a long list with a large and surprising number of examples on it all public and verifiable In the first 100 examples of Timesian expletive avoidance that were collected I started to notice patterns For example articles about HBO shows kept showing up What is HBO after all if not foul mouthed entertainment for Times reading sophisticates I also began to recognize signals that an expletive was being written around Words like expletive profanity four letter and unprintable were frequent indicators and less common ones like saltier This knowledge paved the way for a more systematic approach to data collection In early 2014 I moved the Fit to Print project to Tumblr since it allowed more than 115 characters after a link and the hashtag for context I also registered for a Times API key which let me search all new articles for indicator words When other people would be looking for new cat GIFs I d check the Times Search API instead to see whether any expletives were being avoided that day Around lunchtime when other people would be looking for new cat GIFs I d check the Times Search API instead to see whether any expletives were being avoided that day Saltier returned false positives from the food section but not as often as you d expect Over 2014 and 2015 I collected 663 examples of articles that avoided expletives If an article avoids multiple expletives I counted it only once Some friends who knew about the Fit to Print project shared links with and I stumbled across others while reading Times stories on social media but most of these examples came through the Times Search API these search results had become my main way into the Times I would not claim that this data set is complete evidence of avoidance can be almost as hard to find as evidence of absence Nevertheless rudimentary data analysis yields some interesting insights Unsurprisingly the big day for expletive avoidant articles with 36 of all examples is Sunday The Sunday paper is the fattest and includes the most articles It also has sections dedicated to topics where expletives are most often avoided such as the arts and blow job and sports plus the magazine which avoided expletives in 43 articles in 2015 almost once per issue The morning after a 2005
